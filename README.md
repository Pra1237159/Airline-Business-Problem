# Airline-Business-Problem
**Business Problem**
Our company has a long-standing reputation for providing top-tier air transportation services, ensuring a safe, comfortable, and convenient experience for our passengers. We operate a diverse fleet of aircraft, from small business jets to medium-sized planes. However, we are currently facing several significant challenges that are impacting our profitability. These challenges include stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market leading to higher labor costs. To address these issues, we plan to analyze our database to identify opportunities to increase our occupancy rate, thereby boosting the average profit earned per seat.

**Key Obstacles**

**Stricter Environmental Regulations**: The aviation industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, resulting in more stringent environmental laws. These regulations raise operating costs and limit potential expansion opportunities.

**Higher Flight Taxes**: Governments globally are imposing heavier taxes on aircraft to address environmental concerns and generate revenue. These increased flight taxes have raised the overall cost of flying, subsequently reducing demand.

**Tight Labor Market and Increased Labor Costs**: The aviation sector is experiencing a shortage of skilled workers, leading to higher labor costs and increased turnover rates.

Similar to the booking pattern, the revenue shows a sharp increase from June 22 to mid-July, peaking around mid-August.The revenue stabilizes with minor fluctuations following the initial surge, indicating a consistent inflow.

**Recommendations and Solution:**

**Maximize Occupancy Rate:**
1. Target High-Demand Periods: The data shows a clear peak in bookings and revenue from late June to mid-August. Focus marketing efforts and promotional deals during these periods to maximize occupancy.
Dynamic Pricing: Implement dynamic pricing strategies to optimize revenue during high-demand periods and offer discounts during low-demand periods to encourage bookings.
2. Loyalty Programs: Enhance loyalty programs to retain frequent flyers and encourage repeat business during low-demand periods.
**Optimize Fleet Utilization:**
1. High-Capacity Aircraft: Utilize larger aircraft (e.g., 773 and 763) during peak times to accommodate more passengers and maximize revenue.
2. Small to Medium Aircraft: Deploy smaller aircraft (e.g., 319, 320, 321, 733) during off-peak times or for routes with lower demand to reduce operational costs.
