# Airline-Business-Problem
**Business Problem**
Our company has a long-standing reputation for providing top-tier air transportation services, ensuring a safe, comfortable, and convenient experience for our passengers. We operate a diverse fleet of aircraft, from small business jets to medium-sized planes. However, we are currently facing several significant challenges that are impacting our profitability. These challenges include stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market leading to higher labor costs. To address these issues, we plan to analyze our database to identify opportunities to increase our occupancy rate, thereby boosting the average profit earned per seat.

**Key Obstacles**

**Stricter Environmental Regulations**: The aviation industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, resulting in more stringent environmental laws. These regulations raise operating costs and limit potential expansion opportunities.

**Higher Flight Taxes**: Governments globally are imposing heavier taxes on aircraft to address environmental concerns and generate revenue. These increased flight taxes have raised the overall cost of flying, subsequently reducing demand.

**Tight Labor Market and Increased Labor Costs**: The aviation sector is experiencing a shortage of skilled workers, leading to higher labor costs and increased turnover rates.
