# Airline-Business-Problem
**Business Problem**
Our company has a long-standing reputation for providing top-tier air transportation services, ensuring a safe, comfortable, and convenient experience for our passengers. We operate a diverse fleet of aircraft, from small business jets to medium-sized planes. However, we are currently facing several significant challenges that are impacting our profitability. These challenges include stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market leading to higher labor costs. To address these issues, we plan to analyze our database to identify opportunities to increase our occupancy rate, thereby boosting the average profit earned per seat.

**Key Obstacles**

**Stricter Environmental Regulations**: The aviation industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, resulting in more stringent environmental laws. These regulations raise operating costs and limit potential expansion opportunities.

**Higher Flight Taxes**: Governments globally are imposing heavier taxes on aircraft to address environmental concerns and generate revenue. These increased flight taxes have raised the overall cost of flying, subsequently reducing demand.

**Tight Labor Market and Increased Labor Costs**: The aviation sector is experiencing a shortage of skilled workers, leading to higher labor costs and increased turnover rates.

# Basic Analysis

Similar to the booking pattern, the revenue shows a sharp increase from June 22 to mid-July, peaking around mid-August.The revenue stabilizes with minor fluctuations following the initial surge, indicating a consistent inflow.

**Recommendations and Solution:**

**Maximize Occupancy Rate:**
1. Target High-Demand Periods: The data shows a clear peak in bookings and revenue from late June to mid-August. Focus marketing efforts and promotional deals during these periods to maximize occupancy.
Dynamic Pricing: Implement dynamic pricing strategies to optimize revenue during high-demand periods and offer discounts during low-demand periods to encourage bookings.
2. Loyalty Programs: Enhance loyalty programs to retain frequent flyers and encourage repeat business during low-demand periods.
   
**Optimize Fleet Utilization:**
1. High-Capacity Aircraft: Utilize larger aircraft (e.g., 773 and 763) during peak times to accommodate more passengers and maximize revenue.
2. Small to Medium Aircraft: Deploy smaller aircraft (e.g., 319, 320, 321, 733) during off-peak times or for routes with lower demand to reduce operational costs.

# Aircaft Specific Analysis

**Total revenue per year and tickets sold per year by aircraft:**

**Average price per seat for each aircraft:**
![alt_text](https://github.com/Pra1237159/Airline-Business-Problem/blob/main/avg%20price%20per%20seat%20vs%20acft.png)

1. Aircraft SU9 generates the highest total revenue (approx. 5.1 billion) and sells the most tickets per year (approx. 350,000).
2. Aircraft CN1 generates the least revenue (approx. 96 million) and sells the least number of tickets (approx. 50,000).
3. 763 and 773 aircraft also perform well in terms of revenue but have fewer ticket sales compared to SU9.

**Revenue per ticket sold by Aircraft:**
![alt_text](https://github.com/Pra1237159/Airline-Business-Problem/blob/main/r%20per%20ticket.png)

1. Aircraft 319 has the highest revenue per ticket (approx. 51,201), indicating premium pricing or long-haul flights.
2. CN1 has the lowest revenue per ticket (approx. 6,568), suggesting it might be used for shorter or low-cost flights.
3. 763 and 773 aircraft also have relatively high revenue per ticket (approx. 35,033 and 23,765 respectively).

**Occupancy Rate by Aircraft:**

**Increase in revenue for 10% higher occupancy**
![alt_text](https://github.com/Pra1237159/Airline-Business-Problem/blob/main/R%20incearsed.png)

1. Aircraft 773 has the highest occupancy rate (approx. 65.9%), indicating it is frequently utilized and in demand.
2. CR2 has the lowest occupancy rate (approx. 42.97%), suggesting it might be underutilized.
3. 733, SU9, and 321 aircraft also have good occupancy rates (above 50%).

# Recommendations

**Optimize Fleet Utilization:**

1. Maximize High-Performing Aircraft: Increase the number of flights for SU9 and 773, focusing on high-demand routes to maximize revenue.
2. Reallocate Underperforming Aircraft: Assess routes and demand for CR2 and CN1 to identify opportunities for better deployment or potential phase-out if not profitable.

**Pricing Strategy:**
1. Dynamic Pricing for Low Occupancy Aircraft: Implement dynamic pricing strategies for aircraft like 319 and CR2 to boost occupancy rates while maintaining profitability.
2. Leverage High Revenue per Ticket: Continue leveraging premium pricing for 319 and 773, ensuring these aircraft are deployed on routes where higher ticket prices are sustainable.

**Route Optimization:**

1. Focus on High-Demand Routes: Increase the frequency of flights on popular routes served by SU9 and 773 to capture more market share.
2. Redistribute Low-Demand Routes: Consider redistributing or reducing flights on low-demand routes served by CR2 and CN1, reallocating these resources to more profitable routes.

**Marketing and Promotions:**

1. Targeted Marketing Campaigns: Launch targeted marketing campaigns to boost awareness and sales for underutilized aircraft, focusing on routes where these aircraft operate.
2. Seasonal Promotions: Use seasonal promotions to increase ticket sales during off-peak times, particularly for aircraft with lower occupancy rates.

**Operational Efficiency:**

1.Improve Scheduling: Optimize flight schedules to reduce downtime and increase the number of flights per aircraft, focusing on high-demand periods.
2. Cost Management: Implement cost-saving measures across operations, such as fuel-efficient practices and lean staffing models, to mitigate the impact of rising costs.
